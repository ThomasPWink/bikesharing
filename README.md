## Summary
The NYC bike sharing program has the most activity around tourist areas and transportation hubs.  The highest starting and ending locations are the base of the bridge and the subway stations.  For this program to be successful in Des Moines with a smaller tourist population, the program would have to take advantage of public transportation areas and be a last mile option to the final location of the user.  Another visualization would be to compare trips to the population of that area to determine percentage of usage.  Another visualization would be comparing the income of areas to see if there is a correlation to usage with subscribers as well.
